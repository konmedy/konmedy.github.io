Changelog for the version 1.0.3 - Balance FINALLY adjusted:

+ Added custom death messages
+ Created the Tester team and a Tester rank on the server.
- Permanently deleted Light Drill
- Removed the Double Ores and Triple Ores scenarios
* Nerfed Stellar Armor
* Rewritten the ore probabilities
* Changed the Event Star crafting

-- Death Messages --
The majority if not every death message is now custom.

-- Testers --
I've made a tester team for the server. People interested in testing out the updates before they will get put out in for a quality/balance check, please contact me in Discord DM's.
> Keep in mind that a Tester rank is a volunteer position.

-- Nerfs & Buffs --
> Nerfs will be labeled with a "-", buffs will be labeled with a "+".
- Stellar Helmet: Changed the level of the Protection enchant to IV (4), no crafting changes
- Stellar Chestplate: Changed the level of the Protection enchant to IV (4), no crafting changes
- Stellar Leggings: Changed the level of the Protection enchant to IV (4), no crafting changes
- Stellar Helmet: Changed the level of the Protection enchant to IV (4), no crafting changes

-- Crafting alterations --
Event Star:
The Event Star's crafting was fully altered. Now to craft the Event Star, you'll need 2 golden ingots, 1 diamond block, 2 iron ingots, 1 obsidian, 1 lapis block, 1 redstone block, and 1 emerald.
> If there will be a game hosted tomorrow, the new crafting may change, depending on whether this change makes enough difference to the game's balance.

-- Final Ore Probability Change --
Ores probability of spawning has been changed.
Due to ores spawning too high, I've changed the Y level of ore generation.
From y60 to y0 you can find iron and coal.
From y40 to y0 you can find lapis and redstone.
From y35 to y0 you can find gold.
From y25 to y0 you can find emeralds and diamonds.
