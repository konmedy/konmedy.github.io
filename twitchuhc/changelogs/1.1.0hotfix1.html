<b>HOTFIX #1 FOR VERSION 1.1.0 CONCENTRATED ON PLAYER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENT AND MINOR GAME TWEAKS.
WITH THIS HOTFIX THE "PTV" TITLE FOR THE VERSION 1.1.0 HAS BEEN REMOVED, AS IT WAS FULLY TESTED AND A HOTFIX WAS PUT OUT.</b>

This will be the first and the last hotfix for TwitchUHC version 1.1.0.

1. Deathmatch has been enabled.
  Deathmatch event will now occur 30 minutes into the game.
  The Deathmatch border will shrink for 15 minutes, from 120x120 to 20x20.

2. UHC Timed events intervals changed.
  The time intervals between the timed events have been changed.
  From now on, the timed events will occur like this:
    Game starting countdown: 30 seconds.
    Invincibility: At the start of the game, lasts 45 seconds. When on, everybody will have a speed boost.
    PvP enabled: 10 minutes in.
    Final Heal: 15 minutes in. <!-- fuck you freak there you have it -->
    Border starts to close in: 20 minutes in.
    Border will shrink for: 5 minutes.
    Deathmatch starts: 30 minutes in
    Deathmatch border starts to close in: 5 minutes into the Deathmatch.
    Deathmatch border will shrink for: 5 minutes.

    Game will stop doing timed events: 45 minutes into the game

3. Ending notes
  The core UHC won't be made easier, as I'm aiming for creating a Hypixel UHC-like experience.
  That means that there will be no scenarios (the only scenario I would add is a "random drop" scenario for special UHC events)
  That also means that I will be working on custom crafts.
  I'm still thinking if I should make kits (such as kit tools) or should I leave it as it is.
  Even if I would settle for no kits, I would still make extremely basic kits containing a single item such as 32 wooden planks, 16 steak etc.
  I think I will be able to make a statement about kits in like 1-3 days.
