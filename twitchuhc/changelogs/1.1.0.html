<b>-- New UHC plugin --</b>
The plugin TwitchUHC was using was UHCCore. Well, not anymore.
TwitchUHC is now no longer using UHCCore and is now using an entirely different UHC plugin.
I was cherry-picking the plugins that seemed the best for TwitchUHC and started testing every single one of them.
Now TwitchUHC will have a better core plugin and probably the UHC plugin added today won't change in a long time.
That doesn't mean that I won't look for more ways to improve the UHC plugin, even if that means replacing it again.

<b>-- Cosmetic Revamp/New Branding Colors --</b>
Every part of the server has been cosmetically revamped.
I was aiming for making it more clear and just overally clean.
Another thing that I have changed about the server looks are the branding colors.
The branding colors of TwitchUHC were gold and pink. Now they have been changed to white and pink.
For example, this is how the message that shows up when you join looks like:

<b>-- Donation Store --</b>
I am running out of funds to host TwitchUHC. Not only that, but I also have to pay for more resources to be able to continue hosting UHC's.
That's why there will be a donation store so the server will be able to continue running.
When the donation store will go public, it will get announced on the server itself and on our <a href="https://www.discord.gg/z2FFX2p">Discord server</a>.

<b>-- Blacklist system --</b>
There is now a blacklist system for people who:
- Evade bans
- Try to harm the server
- Continue to break the rules after they got unbanned even though their punishment was justified.
- Break the law
If you've been blacklisted, you're no longer welcome on the server or in anywhere that has anything to do with TwitchUHC.

<b>-- New Anticheat --</b>
I bought a new anticheat.
There's nothing more to say about this.
The anticheat I have bought is just better.

<b>-- /stats command --</b>
You can now check statistics of people on the server using the /stats command.
Usage: /stats (user)
<i><b>Note:</b> The statistics from before 31/08/2020 (DD/MM/YYY) won't be counted.</i>
This is how the stats message will look like:

<b>-- Temporary removal of all custom crafts/kits --</b>
I thought of custom crafts as a thing that would be a signature thing about my event. But that just turned into meta items.
Like the Drill. It was too OP, but also too signature to nerf. So I thought: with a fresh server start, let's start filling up custom items as we go again!
So now you're gonna get better, more unique, and obviously <b>new</b> custom crafts!
Kits will probably will stay the same, but they're gonna be disabled for a couple of days so I will be able to make more kits.
Next reason why I temporarily took away custom crafts is that the UHC plugin doesn't have them built in, so I will have to make a custom plugin for that, and I don't have time for that right now.

Just wait. I'll add the crafts and kits eventually.

<b>-- Unban All --</b>
My punishment plugin has a .db file that stores every single punishment in it. It's basically a punishment database.
Well, today I deleted this file. That caused the plugin to generate a new .db file.
That means that every single punishment that was handed out has been removed now.
If you've been banned on TwitchUHC, your punishment is not active anymore, even if it was permanent.

<b>-- Ending Notes --</b>
I was working a lot on this update and I am really glad to be able to release this changelog to the public today.
TwitchUHC is really fun to host, create, update etc. and I'm really glad I still am able to maintain the server.
Updates will now take longer but will be bigger, better, and of course: fully tested.

Thank you for reading the changelog, and I hope you'll enjoy the server and the update I described in this changelog.
