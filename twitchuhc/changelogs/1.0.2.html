-- Nerfs --
Star Chestplate - Removed the Thorns enchant, no crafting changes
Lunar Blade - Changed the level of the Sharpness enchant to VI (6), now only 4 Event Stars are needed for crafting

-- Buffs --
Star Boots - Changed the level of the Feather Falling enchant to XX (20), no crafting changes

-- Light Drill Disabled --
The Light Drill has been disabled for balancing. For a maximum of 1 day I will be working on the Light Drill nerf (Light Drill nerf details will be announced in a 1.0.2.1 changelog).
For now I think I will just make it a little bit more expensive.

-- Message System --
Just a simple messaging system, so people can contact each other through the server.
